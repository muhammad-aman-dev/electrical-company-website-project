1. Electrical System Design & Planning

Creating electrical layout drawings and load calculations

Coordinating with architects and civil engineers

Ensuring compliance with electrical codes and safety standards

2. Electrical Installation

Wiring and cabling throughout the building

Installing switchboards, circuit breakers, and distribution panels

Connecting power to outlets, lighting, and equipment

Installing backup power systems (generators, UPS)

3. Lighting Systems

Installing indoor and outdoor lighting

Smart lighting systems and energy-efficient solutions (LED, sensors, etc.)

4. Power Systems

Setting up main electrical panels and sub-panels

Power distribution for HVAC, lifts, water pumps, etc.

5. Low Voltage & Special Systems

Fire alarm systems

CCTV and security systems

Access control systems

Data and communication cabling (LAN, telephone, Wi-Fi networks)

6. Maintenance & Testing

Electrical safety inspections

Troubleshooting and repairs

Preventive maintenance contracts

Load testing and energy audits

🏗️ Relationship with the Main Construction Company:

The construction company (often called a General Contractor) hires the Electrical Contractor as a subcontractor.

The electrical contractor works alongside other trades (like plumbing, HVAC, etc.) to complete the building.

Would you like me to also list other types of subcontractors (like plumbing, HVAC, etc.) that usually work under a main construction company? That might give you the full picture of how a building project team is structured.
